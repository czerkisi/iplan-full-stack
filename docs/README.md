Overview
========

The problem with traditional iCal is that it only allows for one user to edit a calendar at a time. This can become a hindrance for organizations where multiple people need to add, edit, and view events on the same calendar. However, iPlan solves this problem by providing a way for multiple users to interface with the same iCalendar (ICS) file and serving it in a format that existing iCalendar feeds can process. This means that multiple users can now add, edit, and view events on the same calendar simultaneously.
